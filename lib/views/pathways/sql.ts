 * member — the oncoprint's merged-row rule, so a set's percentage is over the UNION of its
 * members' panels. Built from exactly the CTEs geneCountsSql uses (same event table, the same
 * high-level-CNA rule, the same driver join, the same panel coverage), so a one-gene set gives
 * that gene's own 'any' counts.
